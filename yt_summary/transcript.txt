3:55
there's so many layers about this city
3:58
and look at the way they plan their
3:59
buildings vintage style i love the
4:02
facade right density and the density is
4:05
pretty high that means high plot ratio
4:08
more plot ratio means more homes for the
4:11
society that also means more deals right

long it's too strong it's very strong
5:51
they scare people away it's very
5:53
aggressive they lose the deal and some
5:56
people they stay out of the spice they
5:59
stay out of the spice for too i'm sorry
6:02
but you know this
6:05
you have my respect but I got my own way
6:07
of eating it i love it i love it but uh
6:09
some people they stay out of the spice
6:11
they're too weak nobody takes them
6:13
seriously but you know how I do this
6:16
sometimes I dip in the spice but
6:19

6:21
